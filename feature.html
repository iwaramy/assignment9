1.	Map – I added map as a background image as an indication for location. The user can easily access the location information of the company.

2.	Contact Information – I added contact information as address, phone number, and/or email address. This are the essential tool while communicating with the potential future clients. The tool will also help connect us with the website user and get more information about them.

3.	Hover- I added hover in Private Lessons Part to make it easy to read and follow through the website. This adds in more distinctive features to the part or text while the user is using the webpage. The bold features is user friendly for individuals who have difficulty following the text in the website.

4.	alt tags
I added alt tags for individuals who are visually impaired. These feature uses a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a website out loud), and are the only way a user knows what the image is.

5.	Email Subscription
I added a subscription area to build a list of potential future customers. Every user will have an email address and not always an active social media account which means having this feature get us an access to the clients.
